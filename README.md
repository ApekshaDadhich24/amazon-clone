# amazon-clone
The Amazon Clone project is a front-end development exercise to replicate Amazon's user interface using HTML and CSS. It includes key sections like the navigation bar, product listings, and footer, focusing on layout and responsive design. This project has deepened my understanding of structuring and styling e-commerce websites.
